# AppledocTemplates
These are the files needed to customize a standard Appledocs installation for use in building the Worldpay Total documentation suite. After downloading/cloning this repository, run **installtemplates.sh** from Terminal.  This will copy the files over to ~/.appledocs one of the folders where appledocs looks for its template files.
